# Fast Gradient Vector Flow

This package implements the Gradient Vector Flow (GVF) in C++/MEX.

The C++/MEX implementation of Gradient Vector Flow (GVF) is much faster than the Matlab implementation.

There is a demo.m file in this package, which shows how to run a simple demo.

The package is used by:
