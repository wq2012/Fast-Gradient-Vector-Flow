# Fast Gradient Vector Flow [![View Fast Gradient Vector Flow (GVF) on File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/images/matlab-file-exchange.svg)](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/45896-fast-gradient-vector-flow-gvf)

This package implements the Gradient Vector Flow (GVF) in C++/MEX.

The C++/MEX implementation of Gradient Vector Flow (GVF) is much faster than the Matlab implementation.

There is a demo.m file in this package, which shows how to run a simple demo.

The package is used by:
